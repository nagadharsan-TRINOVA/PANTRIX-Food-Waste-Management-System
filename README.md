## ❗ Problem Statement
Nearly **one-third of global food production is wasted every year**, with the majority occurring in **households and restaurants**.  
This waste is mainly caused by:
- Forgotten or misunderstood expiry dates  
- Overbuying and poor inventory management  
- Lack of real-time tracking and personalized reminders  
- Plate and preparation waste in restaurants  

The result is **resource loss, methane emissions, food insecurity, and economic loss**, despite millions facing hunger.
